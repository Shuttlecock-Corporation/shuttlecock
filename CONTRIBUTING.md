## Getting Started

1. Read `README.md` to understand the project scope

3. Browse GitHub Issues and Discussions
4. Comment on an issue you want to work on before starting

This avoids duplicated effort and misalignment.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make focused, well-scoped changes
4. Write or update tests where applicable
5. Submit a Pull Request (PR)

Each PR should:
- Solve one clearly defined problem
- Include a concise description
- Reference relevant issues or discussions

---

## Code Quality Expectations

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid premature optimization
