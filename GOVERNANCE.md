# Shuttlecock Governance

This document defines how decisions are made and how the project is managed.

The goal of this governance model is to maintain technical clarity, project stability, and long-term sustainability.

---

## Governance Model

Shuttlecock follows a **BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life)** model during early development.

This means:
- One primary project lead has final decision authority
- Decisions are made to benefit the project, not individuals
- Feedback and dissent are encouraged, but resolution is decisive

This model may evolve as the project matures.

---

## Decision Making

### Technical Decisions
- Based on evidence, benchmarks, and code quality
- Discussed openly via GitHub Issues or Discussions
- Final decisions are documented publicly

### Non-Technical Decisions
- Focus on project health and contributor experience
- Made transparently whenever possible

---

## Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who:
- Have demonstrated sustained, high-quality contributions
- Understand the project architecture
- Actively review pull requests
- Uphold project standards

Maintainers may:
- Review and merge PRs
- Guide contributors
- Own specific subsystems

Maintainer status is granted by the project lead.

---

## Contributor Conduct

All contributors are expected to:
- Communicate professionally
- Respect differing technical opinions
- Avoid hostile or dismissive behavior
- Keep discussions focused on the work

Repeated violations may result in loss of contribution privileges.

---

## Conflict Resolution

When disagreements arise:
1. Attempt resolution through technical discussion
2. Refer to benchmarks, data, or documented principles
3. If unresolved, the project lead makes a final decision

Decisions are final to prevent stagnation.

---

## Scope Control

To protect the project:
- Features outside the defined scope may be rejected
- Simpler solutions are preferred over complex ones
- Long-term maintainability is prioritized over short-term performance

Not all good ideas belong in Shuttlecock.

---

## Changes to Governance

This governance model may evolve as:
- The contributor base grows
- The project reaches stability milestones

Any changes will be documented and discussed publicly before adoption.

---

## Closing Principle

Shuttlecock is governed to remain:
- Technically rigorous
- Community-respectful
- Focused on real-world impact
